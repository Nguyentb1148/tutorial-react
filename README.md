# React and Redux Basic Project

This project is a simple starter template for working with **React** and **Redux**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.\
You can also check for any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, check the [testing guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
React is bundled in production mode and optimized for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.\
Your app is now ready for deployment!

For deployment details, refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert back!**

If you want more control over the build configuration (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project.

After ejecting, you'll be fully responsible for managing these configurations.

For most projects, ejecting is not recommended. The curated feature set provided by Create React App should be enough for most cases.

## About This Project

This project provides a basic setup using React for the UI and Redux for state management. It demonstrates how to use Redux with React in a simple and organized way.

### Key Features:
- **React**: The core library used for building the user interface.
- **Redux**: Manages the application's state, with actions, reducers, and a central store.
- **React-Redux**: Connects React with Redux to provide state management through hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`).
